        <h2>Think of a context and an environment where you would like to
            intervene. Where will you present your project? Who is it made for?</h2>
         <p>Our space welcomes plant-enthusiast who wish to enjoy a mindful and purposeful moment
            with their plants. As we step away from the mere satisfaction that most social platforms
            instantly provide, our project focuses on being consistent and gradually observing healthy
            plant growth. Users observe the progress of their plants and need to be patient. Since
            there is no direct dependency on the app, meaning the app serves a tool to optimize a
            healthy growing plant, the interaction between the user and the app will be considered a
            mindful and relaxing activity. Please note that the app is one component of our project.
            Our proposal will mostly highlight the interaction between the plant and the human.</p>   
        <p>Our installation can be presented anywhere there is a variation of sunlight and
            temperature. Therefore, a room with natural light is ideal. This project works best for
            people who are eager to explore means of communication that have been previously
            closed, people who want to enrich the experience of plant keeping, or make it easier.
            Curiosity has a significant impact on regular use of our product since it motivates the user
            to keep taking the actions necessary to nourish the plant.The plant hobbyist must have a
            strong attention to detail and be aware of their environment since the plant will
            communicate its need to be nurtured by emitting signals such as sounds and visuals.</p>
        
            <h2>Think about the kind of relationship you wish to foster among and
                between your users and the artifact or installation. What will your
                project afford users and how would the experience make them reflect
                on themselves, their environment, society and your intentions?</h2>
    
        <p>The aim is to foster a meaningful and profound relationship between the user and the
            plant, leading to self-reflection, introspection and contemplation regarding one's identity,
            their surroundings, and society. This can be achieved through the following means:</p>
    
            <ul>
                <li>Encouraging users to develop a bond with their plants, by regularly listening
                    or visualizing the needs of plants (giving a more feasible identity to the plant)</li>
                
                <li>Facilitating self-reflection as users think about their relationship with living
                    species and the role it has on their psyche.</li>
                <li>Promoting a feeling of inner peace, accomplishment, enjoyment, mindfulness
                    during the plant care experience.</li>
                <li>Promoting environmental consciousness.</li>
                <li>Cultivating a sense of community among users by encouraging a mutual
                    passion for plant care and providing opportunities for interaction and
                    collaboration.</li>
                </ul>
    
        <p>It is crucial to emphasize the significance of the Eudominc user experience in our user
            centered design. According to the reading "Quantifying Meaningful Interaction: Developing
            the Eudaimonic Technology Experience Scale," someone who experiences eudaimonia not
            only needs to follow their desires but also needs to act virtuously and in accordance with
            their daimon.</p>
    
        <p>To provide a eudaimonic experience, we must consider eudemonic philosophy, motives,
            pursuits, and experiences. For the user to fully experience the product, they must imagine
            themselves caring for the plant in the long term, continuously nourishing it until it
            completes its life cycle or until uncontrollable external conditions, such as the weather,
            intervenes.</p>
        
        <p>In the case of this project, nurturing a plant does not provide an instant rush of satisfaction
            or materialistic object. Instead, it offers a mindful opportunity to reflect on one's
            environment by prioritizing the need to contribute to it, rather than just receiving from it.</p>
        
        <p>In simple terms, nurturing our emotional well-being involves building a connection with our
            inner selves. Yet, this connection is not easily influenced from within. The inner self often
            requires external catalysts that will force the influence. Therefore, a simple act with a
            simple reward such as gardening could improve emotional state. Now, envision the
            profound enrichment this experience could offer if the simple human-plant relationship
            were to materialize into tangible responses, data, and compelling evidence of this
            interaction. Such tangible feedback would prompt individuals even more to contribute,
            thereby significantly benefiting their mental well-being. Therefore, the user should strive
            for virtuous and healthy ideals by viewing the experience as a moment of personal growth.</p>
        
        <p>This project also serves an environmental purpose, as the user plays a role in directly
            affecting nature and indirectly producing clean air and a greener environment.</p>
    
        <p>Our installation facilitates two-way communication between the plant and the user,
            fostering trust and dialogue between the plant (the "receiver") and the caregiver (the user).
            This experience is made possible through intentionality. In a way, while this app enhances
            the connection, it doesn't override human involvement in a process of atomization (i.e.,
            enabling the plant to care for itself). The human still remains the primary caregiver in this
            scenario (talking to and nurturing the plant). The system simply establishes a more
            effective communication channel, enriching the overall relationship.</p>
    
        <h2>
            Think about the notion of empowerment. Is your artifact really helping
    or challenging users?
        </h2>
    
        <p>Empowerment is important because it enables individuals to recognize and credit
            themselves for what they deserve. When one becomes empowered, depreciation of self
            lessens as one starts the process of production of self which helps immensely with
            confidence.</p>
    
        <p>This platform will be a highly collaborative space that serves as a hub for valuable
            information about the various listed plants, allowing users to help and teach each other
            based on their shared interest and passion.</p>
    
        <p>The uniqueness of users' interactions on the app which is facilitated through the structure
            created by the microcontroller lies in the fact that it encourages a community and a
            community will in return encourage activity. Being seen as a part of a community, gives a
            sense of belonging which could be extremely empowering as well as healing.</p>
    
        <p>Additionally, the fostered connection to nature is also empowering in a sense that grounds
            oneself into the tangible and physical environment. Acts like gardening have proven to
            show therapeutic sensations for the brain, offering a respite from the chaos of everyday
            life, and promoting mindfulness.</p>
    
        <p>Focusing on something uncaringly alive, putting modest effort into its low maintenance
            life,and getting to see it thrive is truly satisfying. This confirmation of one's effort in the
            plant's survival is also empowering. This process does not necessarily rely on a community
            but can immensely benefit from it, making the project truly unique in its approach.</p>
    
        <h2>Think about how to successfully communicate your intentions - what
            Interaction Design Strategies will you employ? What are you trying to
            tell us?</h2>
    
        <p>As we develop our project, our main objective is to employ a feedback loop. Since our focus
            deals with the emotional impact on user when nurturing the plant, the “input affects
            output” and vice versa. In other words, the amount of care given to the plant affects the
            health of the plant. The health of the plant affects the well-being of the user.</p>
    
        <p>A diagram representing our feedback loop is provided below (link:
            https://www.figma.com/file/PwZ4je2vftLz8Ks5nWMSLd/Untitled?type=whiteboard&node-id

        <p>Our project also involves an “gulf of Execution and Evaluation” interaction. In the gulf of
            execution, The user has the intention to nourish the plant. Through navigating through the
            app, they will come to a conclusion on whether to take a specific action in caring for the
            plant. If the action has been done, they will disrupt the components of the soil, signaling to
            the sensors that a change has been made. In the gulf of Evaluation, the composition of the
            soil will be detected by the sensors. Through the data collected by the sensors, an UI
            interface will allow the user to interpret the data into “human-friendly” information, easily
            understandable by the user. The user will then evaluate the plant's needs and take the
            necessary actions to grow a healthy plant.</p>
    
        <p>To deepen the notion of an interactive system in our project, we must consider its system
            type. For this project, our design system will be:</p>
    
        <ul>
            <li>Dynamic: As it goes through its life cycle, the plant responds to changes in its
                environment (moisture level, access to sunlight, soil components). The data
                captured by the senor will become readable by the human on the app, allowing the
                system to dynamically change its performance with or without the human
                intervention. The health of the plant will change over time, making the system
                time-dependent.</li>
            
            <li>
                Closed-loop: The output will be closely monitored, as the system will constantly
    detect certain parameters and send it to a web server. Our primary purpose is to
    monitor the health of the plant in order to maintain a regular state.
            </li>
            <li>Self-regulatory: As time goes by, the system will automatically monitor, assess and
                adapt its state based on its environment. The output will change constantly
                depending on the environment and the human intervention, acting as a disturbance
                to the system. WIth the app, our goal is to minimize human error (eg: watering the
                plant too much or placing it in too much sunlight) and opt for better human intervention or optimal health of the plant. A self-regulatory system is a feedback
                loop (see diagram).</li>
    
            <li>Self-adjusting: The plant will self-adjust itself with time, according to the external
                factors it receives. It will automatically adapt to its environment and evolve. The
                sensors will also keep track of its progression and signal to the user the plant needs.</li>
        
        </ul>
    
        <h2>A Non-Technical Evaluation of Sensors and their associated
            affordances which would ideally support your project's proposed
            Interaction Design strategy.</h2>
    
        <p>A crucial aspect of this project is bringing humans and plants closer to one another.
            This connection will be enabled through the use of sensors and a robust network
            infrastructure to seamlessly transfer data. The sensors that are placed in the soil capture
            nutrients and moisture level, send it to the web server and translate it. The caregiver will
            then be notified to act accordingly either by the app, or the plant will express its needs
            itself by emitting sounds and harmonies .The volume of which will indicate the plant's level
            of thirst or desperation. Plus, we will implement sensors that can capture the frequency of
            voices, so when a human speaks (gives compliments for instance), the frequency of their
            voice will be translated into levels based on the tonality and will output varying intensities
            that will be radiated from the UV lamp straight onto the plant. The light will then affect the
            plant, regulating its growth. Therefore, the collected data will undergo translation,
            transforming into information that is both comprehensible and easily accessible to humans
            and which will further affect the plant, creating a feedback loop. Our technology is designed
            not only to gather information about the plant but also to provide the plant with insights
            about us. This reciprocal exchange of data serves as the foundation for a deeper mutual
            comprehension. We envision creating a space for the plant to interact with humans, for
            example, through sounds, subtle signaling or even eavesdropping on our conversations, tampering with UV lamp light intensity. This approach not only promises a better
            understanding of plants and their needs, but also the ability to be in dialogue with them.
            Such a space can only be facilitated by an external factor that intermediates between the
            two entities that have a barrier of communication and mutual understatement due to their
            biological differences.</p>
    
        <p>In today’s digital age, it's easy for people to forget to appreciate what is around
            them while increasingly nurturing their online presence and existence in the digital world.
            This project will use technologization to its advantages to show that these systems can
            facilitate a connection to surroundings and nature rather than impede it. When the arduino
            dismantles the barrier of communication it is as if the person traverses to a more absurd
            reality.</p>
    
        <h2>Research three similar projects and provide a summary of each. Write a
            paragraph on how/why your project will be different and impactful in
            comparison to the projects you researched.</h2>
    
        <p>Thirsty Flamingo (link to project:
            https://all3dp.com/2/best-3d-printed-arduino-project/#)</p>
    
        <p>Circuito.io’s Thirsty Flamingo is an Arduino project designed to help you monitor the
            moisture levels of your plants. The 3d printed flamingo houses the battery, speaker,
            moisture sensor, and Arduino. It will alert the personvia the Piezo Speaker to let them know
            if moisture levels have dropped.</p>
        
        <p>Our project builds on this foundation, creating a more intricate and dynamic design
            system. There are more modes of interaction in our design. As stated before, The sensors that are placed in the soil capture nutrients and moisture
            level, sending it to the web server for translation.This not only provides real-time
            information about the plants current state but it also offers a much more in depth and
            personalized overview of its habits, behaviors, life cycle and needs in the app server. The
            caregiver is then notified to take appropriate action either through the app or listening to
            the plant's sounds and harmonies. The caregiver is also prompted to speak to the plant;
            Additional sensors capture the frequency of voices based on pitch and will output varying
            intensities radiating from the uv lamp straight unto the plant. This light function, driven by
            human speech, will further influence the plant's growth.</p>
        
        <p>These elements provide more in depth data and comprehensive understanding between
            plants and humans, fostering a richer and more meaningful relationship.</p>
    
        <p>Plant Radio: Tuning in to plants by combining posthumanism and design
            https://moodle.concordia.ca/moodle/pluginfile.php/6063197/mod_page/content/52/
            PLANT_RADIO.pdf</p>
    
        <p>The Plant Radio is an electronic device designed to reveal how a plant responds to its
            environment by amplifying the plant's EMG signals artificially. It draws inspiration from the
            metaphor of a radio broadcast receiver. It permits tuning into intangible signals sent through the
            air. Centered on uncovering the concealed signals emitted by plants, it seeks to reshape the
            relationship between plants and humans. The Plant Radio introduces ideas of
            posthumanism by pivoting around the significance of plants and their true sentient being.</p>
    
        <p>This project is really interesting because although it sheds light on plant behavior adn the
            particular “plant-blindness” phenomena. It not primarily designed as a tool to take car of
            plants with, making the experience a more intentional, feasible endavour. Rather, it focus
            on plant as the “other” being that exists simultiosly as humans as reacts in similar ways to
            us. sudden changes in the plant caused by its immediate surroundings. This means that
            different plants will react differently, depending on the plant’s physiology, time of day, if
            and how it is being touched, odors and sounds in the immediate environment, and many
            other factors</p>
    
        <p>Preventing plant death with technology
            Link to the project:
            https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Fx9zQJe3H4&ab_channel=Emilostuff</p>
    
        <p>In this video, a demonstration and explanation of an automated plant-watering system is
            shown. The purpose of developing this installation is to prevent the plant from dying when
            the person responsible for watering is not nearby. The system sets its own watering
            schedule and also specifies the amount of water and the duration of each watering session.</p>
    
        <p>Although this project includes similar technical processes such as measuring the moisture
            level, its purpose differs from ours, as our project emphasizes the interaction between the
            human and the plant. In our design system, human intervention is widely emphasized. We
            rely on human intentions and interests in order for the plant to grow optimally. The user
            must consider this interaction as way to lighten up their mood develop their interest in
            plants.</p>
